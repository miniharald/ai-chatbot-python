### Model Information

| Model | Best For | Cost (per 1K tokens) |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| GPT-4o | Complex tasks, highest quality | $0.005 input, $0.015 output |
| GPT-4o Mini | Balanced performance and cost | $0.00015 input, $0.0006 output |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | Fast responses, basic tasks | $0.0005 input, $0.0015 output |

## Configuration

Settings are automatically saved in `config.json`:
- `model`: Current model selection
- `temperature`: Response creativity (0.0-2.0)
- `max_tokens`: Maximum response length

## üóÉÔ∏è Conversation History & SQLite Integration

Your chat history is automatically saved to a local SQLite database (`conversations.db`). This enables:

- **Automatic saving** of all conversations and messages
- **Resume any conversation** with `/load`
- **View recent conversations** with `/history`
- **Search your chat history** with `/search`
- **Export conversations** to TXT or JSON with `/export`
- **Delete conversations** with `/delete`
- **View usage statistics** with `/stats`

### Example Usage

```bash
You: /history
# Shows a list of recent conversations
You: /load
# Loads a selected conversation so you can continue
You: /search
# Finds conversations by keyword
You: /export
# Saves a conversation to a file
You: /delete
# Removes a conversation from history
You: /stats
# Shows usage statistics
```

**Note:** Your chat history is stored locally and is private by default. The database file is ignored by git for privacy.

## ‚ö° Streaming Responses & Stop Feature

- **Real-time streaming:** AI responses appear in your terminal as they are generated, for a ChatGPT-like experience.
- **Interrupt anytime:** Press `Ctrl+C` during a response to stop streaming and return to the prompt. The bot will continue running and save the partial response.

### Example
```bash
You: Tell me a story about a robot
AI: Once upon a time... (response streams in real time)
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the response early
‚èπÔ∏è Response stopped by user.
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors
2. **Cost Awareness**: Real-time cost estimation
3. **Configuration Management**: Persistent settings
4. **Model Validation**: Ensures selected models are available
5. **Type Hints**: Better code documentation and IDE support
6. **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns between modules
